# Arithmetic_Logic_Unit.V
This is a basic ALU created in Verilog.  This was initially created for ECE 324-"Digital Design" taught by Tom Pritchard at Washington State University Vancouver and is expanded on as an extracurricular project. 

Feel free to give suggestion on how to improve my coding!

This is also a test to learn git!
